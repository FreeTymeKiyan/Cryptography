#An implementation of AES in python
This is one of the homeworks of CSSE/MA 479 Cryptography. I'm gonna implement AES encryption algorithm in Python.

##Goal
Write a program to implement AES-128.

##Procedure
1. Read a file called aesinput.txt. Format: line 1, 128 bit key; other lines, 128 bit msg. 
2. Take a positive integer as input. Indicating number of iterations of AES.
3. Output file: aes*yourname*out.txt. Contains the labeled results of the intermediate calculations(adding the round key, BS, SR, MC, ARK for each round, the result of applying once).

##Note
###What is AES?
